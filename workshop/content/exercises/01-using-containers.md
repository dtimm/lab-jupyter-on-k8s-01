The typical way that Jupyter notebooks would be run is to run them directly on your own local computer. This involves having the Python language interpreter available

```
virtualenv venv
```

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

```
pip install notebook
```

```
jupyter notebook --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8888
```

%(ingress-protocol)://%(session_namespace)-8888/
