The [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) web site describes Jupyter notebooks as:

> an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

Jupyter notebooks can be deployed direct to Linux, macOS or Windows environments, or in containerized environments such as Docker and Kubernetes.

In this workshop you will learn how you can deploy and use Jupyter notebooks in Kubernetes.
